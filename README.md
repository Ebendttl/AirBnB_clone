Description of the project:

The AirBnB clone project is a web application that replicates the core functionality of the popular accommodation rental platform, AirBnB. The project aims to create a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects, such as users, listings, and bookings. This CLI will allow users to perform operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects, as well as performing various operations and computations on these objects.

Description of the command interpreter:

The command interpreter is a Python-based CLI that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AirBnB objects. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on objects, as well as execute various commands to manage and manipulate the data.

How to start it:

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the AirBnB clone project repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run the main Python script, console.py, using the Python interpreter.

How to use it:

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use it to perform various operations on AirBnB objects. The CLI provides a set of commands and options that allow you to interact with the data stored in the system. You can create new objects, retrieve existing objects, update object attributes, delete objects, and perform other operations such as counting, computing statistics, and more.

Examples:

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

To create a new user: create User
To retrieve a user by ID: show User 123
To update a user's email address: update User 123 email "newemail@example.com"
To delete a user: destroy User 123
To list all users: all User
To count the number of users: count User.
